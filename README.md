# CSE_278_Lab08
MyTime.cpp does not work, I was getting "Undefined References" every time I tried to compile it. The operator overloading has been scrapped too in order to get the code to compile.
As proof I used Makefile correctly a screenshot is in the Q1.pdf. That screenshot is all that Q1 will do so just ignore MyTime.cpp
Q2 and Q3 work properly with an output exactly as expected in the lab instructions.
